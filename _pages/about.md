I am a senior at the Smith College, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics. Currently, I am working with Professor Halie Rando at the Veterinary and Biological Informatics Lab [(VBIL)](https://vbilsmith.github.io/). In my sophomore-year summer, I worked on betting data of soccer outcomes with [Dr. Ronald Yurko](https://github.com/ryurko) in the [Statistics and Data Science Department](https://www.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.  

### Research 

During Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) 2024 at Smith College, I worked on developing a pipeline to convert DOCX files, commonly used by non-technical authors, to Manubot-based Markdown files under the guidance of professors Halie Rando and Michael Robson. Manubot is a collaborative writing tool that leverages open-source software to allow users to write content as Markdown-based text, track contributions using version control, and export manuscripts into various output formats. It offers a distinct computational advantage over other platforms, particularly for large-scale collaborative writing. I built an open-source LLM pipeline that transforms Docx files to Manubot-based Markdown using Llama3.
