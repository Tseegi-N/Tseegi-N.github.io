**Conversion of Docx to Manubot-based Markdown file**

**_2024 Smith College Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship_**

During Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) 2024 at Smith College, I worked on developing a pipeline to convert DOCX files, commonly used by non-technical authors, to Manubot-based Markdown files under the guidance of professors Halie Rando and Michael Robson. I have presented my research at Computational Systems for Integrative Genomics (CSIG) 2024 in New York, NY. I am currently working on refining model selection and prompt engineering using Promptfoo evaluations for speed and accuracy during my special studies.
